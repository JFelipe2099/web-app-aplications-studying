# Web App Aplications Studying
This is a repository for some simple web applications (e.g. calculator, todo app, etc) that I have been doing to track my learning process.

Here I document these projects and how I solve the problems that I come across while doing them. Latter on I make them work more efficiently as my knowledge in the area grows.
